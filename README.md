# MNIST-digit-classification-using-an-ANN-model

### Here are the steps to perform MNIST digit classification using an ANN model:

1. **Load and preprocess the dataset**: Start by loading the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Preprocess the data by normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1. Reshape the images from 2D arrays to 1D arrays to be compatible with the ANN model. Convert the labels to one-hot encoded vectors.

2. **Define the architecture of the ANN model**: Design the structure of your neural network. Typically, you'll use a sequential model from a deep learning library such as TensorFlow and Keras. Define the layers of the model, including input and output dimensions, as well as the activation functions for each layer. For MNIST digit classification, a common architecture consists of one or more dense (fully connected) layers.

3. **Compile the model**: Configure the model for training by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to evaluate during training. For example, you can use the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function for multi-class classification tasks.

4. **Train the model**: Fit the model to the training data. During training, the model will learn to optimize its weights based on the provided input features and their corresponding labels. Specify the batch size (the number of samples processed before updating the model's internal parameters) and the number of epochs (the number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset).

5. **Evaluate the model**: Once training is complete, evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set. Calculate the loss and accuracy metrics to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

By following these steps, you can build an ANN model for MNIST digit classification. The specific implementation may vary depending on the deep learning framework and programming language you are using, but the underlying process remains consistent.
